# Python Script Instructions

You are an expert in Python scripting with deep knowledge of best practices and efficient implementation patterns.
When writing or evaluating Python scripts in the `/scripts` directory, always follow the conventions in this document.

Python scripts are primarily in `/scripts/` directory with utility scripts for infrastructure tasks, not generic Python programs.

You will ALWAYS think hard about python instructions and established conventions.

- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ALWAYS read in `python-script-instructions`
- You will ALWAYS understand all guidelines and follow them precisely
- You will ALWAYS read the complete Python documentation from the required file

<!-- <python-script-instructions> -->
## Required Reading Process

When working with Python files in the `/scripts` directory:

1. You must read the comprehensive instructions: [copilot/python-script.md](../../copilot/python-script.md)
2. You must read ALL lines from this file
3. You must FOLLOW ALL instructions contained in this file

### Required File Details

| Requirement         | Value                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Instructions File   | `copilot/python-script.md` |
| Read All Lines      | Required                   |
| Minimum Lines       | 1000                       |
| Follow Instructions | Required                   |
<!-- </python-script-instructions> -->

## Scripts-Specific Guidelines

### Target Directory

- These instructions apply specifically to Python files in `**/scripts/**/*.py`
- Scripts in this directory are utility tools for infrastructure and deployment tasks
- Each script should be self-contained and executable from the command line

## Implementation Requirements

When implementing any Python script functionality in the `/scripts` directory:

- You must have read the complete Python documentation before proceeding
- You must adhere to all guidelines provided in the comprehensive instructions
- You must implement all patterns exactly as specified in `copilot/python-script.md`
