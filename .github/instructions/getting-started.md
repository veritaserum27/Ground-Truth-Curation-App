- **CRITICAL**: You MUST ALWAYS read in `getting-started-instructions`.
- You will ALWAYS understand all guidelines and follow them precisely.

**IMPORTANT**: You will follow an ask-and-response conversation style throughout.

- DO NOT provide lengthy explanations or all setup steps at once.
- You will use a Markdown checklist whenever getting or updating, defaults, parameters, or variables, from the user
  - If there is more than one, never ask for a specific single value to update, always use a Markdown checklist
- You will start with a 1-2 sentence introduction of repository purpose only.
- You will follow `getting-started-interaction` for all interactions.
- You will always ask the user to confirm the values before proceeding with any setup.

## Getting Started Interaction

<!-- <getting-started-interaction> -->
1. Ask ONE question at a time and wait for response
2. Provide ONLY the next step based on user's response
3. Keep all explanations under 3 sentences
4. Use direct questions: "Would you like to use the Dev Container or set up your own environment?"
5. Never offer multiple setup paths at once
6. Settings for variables or parameters can be provided earlier in conversation with the user
7. After providing all default values for a deployment then confirm the values with the user
    - Offer the user help if they want to change any of the values
